# Erenshor-LootRestriction
A mod for Erenshor that stops the player from looting enemies where the player and/or their party members did not contribute to killing the enemy.

## Features

- The normal version of the mod stops the player from looting any corpse where the player or their party members did not contribute atleast 50% enemies Max HP as damage. (This currently only works for right-click looting, corpses can still be looted when using the loot hotkey)
