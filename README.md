# Erenshor-LootRestriction
A mod for Erenshor that adds an Item Compare Window to the game in order to enhance equipment comparison. The Mod displays a side-by-side UI panel allowing you to compare an item you are currently viewing with the item you have equipped.

## Features

- Automatically displays the details of equippable items when hovered over.
- Dynamically displays a comparison window if you have an item equipped in the same slot as the item you are looking at requires.
- Switches comparison between Primary and Secondary slots when needed via key input (default: F).

## Requirements

BepInEx 5 is required for this mod to work.

## Installation

1. [Install BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
2. Download the one of the `.zip` files from [Releases](https://github.com/Brad522/Erenshor-LootRestriction/releases) depending on which version you want.
3. Extract all files into your Erenshor folder.

## Usage

- The normal version of the mod stops the player from looting any corpse where the player or their party members did not contribute atleast 50% enemies Max HP as damage. (This currently only works for right-click looting, corpses can still be looted when using the loot hotkey)
- The (Auto-Remove Corpses) version of the mod automatically removes any corpse that would be unlootable in the normal version of the mod.
